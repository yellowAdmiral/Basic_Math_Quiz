# Basic_Math_Quiz

The game is a basic math quiz that randomly creates basic math problems and gives four options out of which one is correct.
I have used Cordova to create this webapp , it can easily be converted into a cross platform web app by uploading the game/www.zip file to adobe.phonegap. 
This is my first project regarding this topic , hope you like it , ot maybe improve on it , also I have still no idea how github works .
